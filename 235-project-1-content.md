# Build-A-Boat
### It's like every other clicker game in existence...but with boats

#### Genres
Incremental Idle Clicker

#### Platforms
Mobile Tablet Computer

#### Story
You are a young man/woman with a single dream: To build as many boats as humanly possible. There's only one way to achieve this dream: You must recruit as many boat-builders to help you as possible, (Including the legendary Dr. Cannoli) but their assistance doesn't come cheap. Build boats, recruit boat-builders, earn achievements, and watch your empire grow as your boat count reaches ridiculous heights!

#### Aesthetics
* The graphics will be extremely cartoonish and basic, just a bunch of small sprites.
* The sound will likely be some ambient looped music, with small beeps and such for clicking on different things.
* There will also be beeps for clicking on the ship, and a sound effect for getting achievements.
#### Gameplay
The only thing you need to worry about is your mouse. Click on the large ship to gain part of a ship. Click on things in the shop (if you have the ships to buy it) to buy that item. Slide the volume sliders to decrease the volume. That's all you have to do. The mechanics of this game are pretty basic.
